1. To see location of my comments
   1. =sudo apt install ripgrep=
   2. From the base directory: rg //!
      - This searches through all files for //!


2. The rigid2d binary should not be in the git repository src/turtlelib/rigid2d as that is the output of compilation

3. Your code passes all of my tests! (which is no guarantee of 100% working, but is a good start).

Overall, great job, just some minor coding-style tips have been included.
